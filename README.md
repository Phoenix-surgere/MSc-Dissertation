# MSc-Dissertation
This is the final deliverables for my MSc dissertation in (Cooperative) Multi-Agent (Deep) Reinforcement Learning ( quite the mouthful ain't it?). Honestly. I am not particularly proud of it, at least with respect to my BSc Dissertation or my original vision, nor do I even think it is very interesting in and of itself. I did what I could with the support I received, and the topic itself is quite challenging on its own so...
