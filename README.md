# MSc-Dissertation
This is the final deliverables for my MSc dissertation in (Cooperative) Multi-Agent (Deep) Reinforcement Learning ( quite the mouthful ain't it?). The topic is quite challenging conceptually, the APIs and the libraries are nanscent and often with little interdependency between them, it is absurdly computationally heavy but it is supremely exciting and full of potential (I think).
